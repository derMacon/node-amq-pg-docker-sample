# Instant Payment Demo

Project to showcase the general approach of processing an instant payment provided by the DPS Gmbh. The focus of the project is to monitor the duration it takes for a swarm of containers to start completely. Currently there is a frontend supplier which is a tool to put multiple payment messages inside a queue which then will be taken in by a consumer container which currently works with nodejs.
